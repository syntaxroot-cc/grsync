# grsync

An rsync-inspired file synchronization tool written in Go.

## Status

CLI parsing, file enumeration, and filter-rule matching are implemented;
data transfer is not. `internal/sync` builds a sorted file list
(`sync.Walk`) and can filter it (`sync.FilterEntries`), but nothing calls
either yet — the CLI only echoes parsed flags — and `internal/transport` is
still empty.

## Build

```sh
go build ./cmd/grsync
```

Or run directly without building a binary:

```sh
go run ./cmd/grsync <source>... <destination> [flags]
```

## Usage

```
grsync <source>... <destination> [flags]
```

At least one `source` and exactly one `destination` are required; the last
argument is always the destination.

| Flag | Shorthand | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--archive` | `-a` | archive mode |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | increase verbosity |
| `--compress` | `-z` | compress data during transfer |
| `--recursive` | `-r` | recurse into directories |
| `--dirs` | `-d` | list directories without recursing into them (implied by `-r`) |
| `--dry-run` | `-n` | show what would be transferred |
| `--delete` | | delete extraneous files from destination |
| `--progress` | | show progress during transfer |
| `--exclude PATTERN` | | exclude matching files (repeatable) |
| `--include PATTERN` | | include matching files (repeatable) |
| `--filter RULE` | | add a filter rule (repeatable) |
| `--exclude-from FILE` | | read exclude patterns from FILE, one per line (repeatable) |
| `--include-from FILE` | | read include patterns from FILE, one per line (repeatable) |

All five filter-related flags share one ordered rule list — their relative
order on the command line is preserved, matching rsync's first-match-wins
semantics. See [Filter Rules](#filter-rules) below.

## File Enumeration

`sync.Walk`, in the `internal/sync` package, recursively lists a source tree
into a sorted `[]FileEntry` (path, size, mtime, mode, uid/gid, symlink
target). Symlinks are captured via `Lstat`, never followed.

`-r`/`-d` control how far it descends:

| Recursive | Dirs | Result |
|---|---|---|
| off | off | directories skipped entirely |
| off | on | directories listed, not descended into |
| on | any | full recursion |

On Windows, `UID`/`GID` are always `0` — there's no POSIX ownership concept
to read, so `0` means "unavailable," not a real value.

## Filter Rules

`sync.CompileRules` turns the ordered `--exclude`/`--include`/`--filter`/
`--exclude-from`/`--include-from` list into ready-to-match rules;
`sync.Included`/`sync.FilterEntries` apply them to `sync.Walk`'s output as
a separate pass, first-match-wins, defaulting to include when nothing
matches.

Pattern syntax: `*` matches within one path segment, `**` crosses segment
boundaries, `?` matches one character. A trailing `/` makes a pattern match
directories only. `--filter` also accepts `merge FILE` to inline another
rule file at that point in the list (one level deep — a merge file that
itself tries to merge another file is an error, not silently ignored).

A pattern anchors to the transfer root — matched once against the full
path, not tried at every depth — if it has a leading `/`, contains any
other `/`, or contains `**`. Only a pattern with none of those (a bare
filename like `*.log`) matches at any depth, against the final path
component only. This matches real rsync's actual anchoring rule.

## Architecture

- `cmd/grsync` — CLI entrypoint.
- `internal/cli` — flag/argument parsing (built on cobra).
- `internal/sync` — file-list generation and filter matching today; comparison/delta logic later.
- `internal/transport` — (placeholder) data movement, local and remote.

Goal: full feature parity with upstream rsync, including protocol/format
interoperability where specified (e.g. batch mode's file format).
